# The opacity level (opposite of transparency) of an unfocused split.
# Unfocused splits by default are slightly faded out to make it easier to see
# which split is focused. To disable this feature, set this value to 1.
# 
# A value of 1 is fully opaque and a value of 0 is fully transparent. Because
# "0" is not useful (it makes the window look very weird), the minimum value
# is 0.15. This value still looks weird but you can at least see what's going
# on. A value outside of the range 0.15 to 1 will be clamped to the nearest
# valid value.
